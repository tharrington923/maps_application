# maps_application

A map application with the ability to provide and visualize routes from one point to another in a map.

This application was completed throughout the Advanced Data Structures in Java Coursera class, one of the classes in the Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond specialization offered by the University of California, San Diego

The front-end code using Google Maps API was designed by the course staff. 

I implemented many of the basic graph search algorithms including breadth first search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and A star Search.

As a project extension, I modified the A star search algorithm to utilize previously computed shortest paths. As a result, directions form any single start node to an end node in a graph is only computed once. In the process of computing the shortest path the first time, all of the shortest paths from a node along the path to the end node are stored.

I attempt to clearly distinguish between the code I authored and the code authored by UCSD.
